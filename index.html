		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>
		Hi! I'm Mike, I live in Austin, TX, and I'm a graphic novel collector, a big time Elon Musk fan, ...big time, a firstborn in a family of 6, and a front end web developer. Born in West Africa, I moved to the US in my preteens, Connecticut to be exact, where I lived, made a host of friends and eventually attained my bachelors degree in business. I transferred to Dallas, TX, towards the end of my time in University, to help manage my families business, and it was during this time that I developed a serious interest in technology entrepreneurship, reading magazines such as Inc., Entrepreneur and Fast Company. 

		I remember designing several geocities web pages in high school and a maintaining blog in high throughout University, mostly for fun, so while not much I have had some familiarity with coding ate a young age. Today I maintain a blog on my journey developing my skills as a front end developer and when I'm not coding, blogging or working I spend time with friends and family spread out all over  Dallas, Houston, and Austin,TX. Always learning.
